"""SQL column picker — the "SQL" button that sits beside every column field.

Anywhere spaCR asks for the *name of a database column* — the annotation
column, the measurement used to prefilter crops, the heatmap feature, the
regression's dependent variable — the field has historically been a bare
text box. Typing into it is blind: nothing tells you what the database
already contains, so ``annotate`` and ``annotaet`` are equally acceptable
and equally silent. The second one starts a brand new annotation pass, and
two passes that should have been one then look like two annotators who
agree on nothing.

This module adds the missing half of that interaction:

``ColumnPickerButton``
    a small ``SQL`` button that can be dropped beside an existing field.

``ColumnPickerDialog``
    the panel it opens — the tables in the database, the columns of the
    selected table with their declared type, and a name box that says, in
    words, what will happen to the name you typed: *used*, *created*, or
    *refused*.

``attach_column_picker``
    a one-liner that wires the two onto a ``QLineEdit``/``QComboBox`` a
    screen has already laid out. It re-uses the field's own slot in its
    parent layout, so a host adopts the picker without restructuring
    anything.

Three properties this file is built around:

* **Read-only.** Opening the picker reads column names and nothing else.
  The connection is ``file:…?mode=ro`` plus ``PRAGMA query_only = ON`` —
  the same pair :mod:`spacr.qt.screens.db_browser` and
  :mod:`spacr.agreement` use — so SQLite itself refuses a write. The
  dialog never creates a column: it returns a *name*, and the write path
  that owns creation (``annotate_engine.ensure_annotation_column``, which
  does it lazily with ``ALTER TABLE``) stays where it is.

* **Cheap on open.** ``PRAGMA table_info`` is free; ``SELECT COUNT(*)``
  over a 400 k-row measurement table is not. Opening the dialog runs no
  count at all. The per-table row figure comes from ``max(rowid)`` and is
  labelled an estimate; a per-column non-null count happens only when the
  user asks for it by name.

* **No modal errors.** A missing database, a file that isn't SQLite, a
  database with no tables, a name SQLite would refuse — every one of them
  is reported in a banner inside the dialog. The dialog itself is the one
  deliberate modal, and it is injectable (:meth:`ColumnPickerButton.
  set_dialog_runner`) so a headless test drives it without ever entering
  an event loop.

    # either wrong is a use-after-free that lands nowhere near here:
    #
    #   1. Between the replace and the re-add, `field` is in no layout. Do
    #      anything that can run Python's pending calls in that window and
    #      shiboken can decide the widget is Python-owned, because nothing on
    #      the C++ side is claiming it. It then has two owners -- the parent
    #      chain and Python -- and whichever destroys it second dereferences
    #      freed memory. So the re-add happens immediately, with nothing
    #      between the two calls.
    #   2. The returned item must not be destroyed while that window is open.
    #      Releasing it (`del`, or just letting it fall out of scope) destroys
    #      the QWidgetItem still pointing at `field`, which is exactly the
    #      ownership flip in (1). Keeping it alive on the wrapper costs one
    #      inert object per picker row and closes the window for good: the
    #      item is out of every layout, so nothing ever traverses it again.
    #
    # The crash this prevents surfaces as SIGSEGV in
    # `Shiboken::callCppDestructor<QLineEdit>` under `mainThreadDeletionHandler`,
    # fired from `_make_pending_calls` at whatever bytecode boundary happened
    # to come next -- typically inside an unrelated eventFilter, minutes after
    # the dialog that owned the field was closed.

    # Visibility is deliberately left alone. Qt's own reparent-into-layout
    # path handles it: QWidget::setParent clears WA_WState_ExplicitShowHide
    # when it hides an already-shown widget, so the field reappears with the
    # wrapper, and QLayout::addChildWidget queues a show for a wrapper added
    # under a parent that is visible right now. Forcing visibility here would
    # set the explicit-show flag and break a collapsed Section's expand.
